                Hello! My name is Jon Aranda. I am 28 years old and have been a bar manager for the last 6 years. 
                I heard about this course from a customer a few months back and have been intrigued by it ever since. 
                I remember taking a few computer science classes in college and enjoying coding. I am still fairly 
                new to the coding game but look forward to all I am going to learn in the upcoming months!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am a Los Angeles native. I went to Loyola High School and Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. 
                I played tennis and studied for 4 years at Carleton where I earned my BA in Mathematics. I believe my
                background in math will help me with the understanding of what is going on when I am coding. 
            </p>
